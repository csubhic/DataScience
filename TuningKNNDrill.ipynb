We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ds4aMP46zewZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Based on the given categories, utilites and enertainment can be selected as potential target variables. But since it involves spending utilies may make more sense when compared to selecting entertainment as the target variable. \n","\n","We can normalize the data with respect to utilities. We can see how much they spent for utilites versus entertainment. Also, can find out how many pays the utilities bill on time versus not. Whoever doesn't pay the bill on time, would be spending money some where else and we can find that data as well."]}]}
